GNU Autotools for OS X
======================

This project builds a standard OS X installer package for Autotools, the GNU
build system. It contains the source distributions for [Autoconf 2.69][1], 
[Automake 1.15][2], and [Libtool 2.4.6][3]


Dependencies
------------
This release was built on OS X 10.10.4 with Xcode 6.4 installed. Building
Automake requires a recent version version of Autoconf; if you don't have
Autoconf, you can download the [prebuilt installer][4] or first run:

    make autoconf

then run the unsigned `autoconf-<version>.pkg` installer package located in the
project `tmp` directory.
